--Todo
--... probably make this a real document.
--And... re-add the liscene, that i removed, for some reason.
--i bet i thought i didnt want/need it.
--i really, really should have it.

This is very informal. However, it should do the job :P

So, for contributes, its actually very likely that i will accept it.

~~However, the more functional, the better more than likely. if its just fixing something then i may have all ready done so... Hopefully
but if you see it and want to, go right ahead :P
Also, as note... the latest update branch (currently 1.0) is the branch i'm working with. 
Once 1.0 is released i will retire the branch and make a new one for the next update.
1.0 will be released once the conditions for the Seperation Milestone have been met~~

Basically wrong. will update once someone wants to contribute lol.
