So, this is just an attempt to make some quality of life improvements to CC. thats it really.

Also, many things that  let you use it as a.. 'family pc' I guess. In this I mean there are currently three levels to the... ehh. "os"~. 

Teir 0 -- Guest. Has very small access... should probably make it even less access.

Teir 1 -- Friend. Should probably rename this 'rank'. This has access to pretty much the whole pc, but isn't allowed out of the main file. (startup.lua). Events are locked out so they cannot use ctrl+t.~~

Teir 2 -- Main. This is you. Default password is 'getting', for puns.


Default password is 'getting' (if you look at the code, you will understand XD)
Also, without edits, it will refer to me as the owner. I plan on adding a way to save a username and password 
NOTE: only need the password to sign in! username is just for a few cool things... Such as saying "Welcome back, X"

Main branch is currently "Link-Jon-1.0" as, i dont want to spam updates into master. Once the Seperation milestone has been reached I will merge this branch, and rename to "1.1". will update that untill the need is there.
Note: if i end up doing a quick bugfix because something in master is broken, it will still be a pullrequest (mostly so i can fix multiple things in a single commit) and it will be x.x.1.


~ I dont want to refer to this as an OS, its not. but its also a bit more than just a library... so i dont know.
~~ If you need to use an event in your code, either use rawBack() (same as os.pullEventRaw()) or check the near the top of startup

Use 'pastebin get 7W48dz3c install' in a CC computer and it will get the five of the 10 files: 
startup
http (as https)
help
maths (as calc)
mtext
dolua
and if needed can download the rest. (I do have it setup this way so it doesnt download unless you need it. Hopeful this will lower filesize.)

So uh. If for some reason you want some code from here,
feel free :P
