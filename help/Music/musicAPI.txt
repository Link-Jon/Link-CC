musicAPI.lua - Does things with dfpwm files.

downloadMusic(filename, userIP, direct)
    Downloads previously split dfpwm chunks, split with splitMusic()
    
    filename = Name of file to download (also what to name the recieved file)
    userIP = "http://URL" | Path to music folder
    Expected file location: userIP/filename/filename# || ie: 127.0.0.1/revenge/revenge1 ../revenge2 ..ect

    direct = Boolean. if true, explicitly download the userIP as 

    This is probably wrong, because i added the 'direct' variable
    ~~This function is rather specific in HOW it downloads files; 
    Im not sure if it will be of use to others if i dont give you my ip.
    Technically i could leave my ip here, but that would not only be...
    anywhere between a waste of my 1mbit/s upload to a complete security risk,
    and i dont have a static ip, it will change weekly lol.~~
