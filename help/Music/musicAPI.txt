musicAPI.lua - Does things with dfpwm files.

downloadMusic(filename, userIP, direct)
    Downloads previously split dfpwm chunks, split with splitMusic()
    
    filename = Name of file to download (also what to name the recieved file)
    userIP = "http://URL" | Path to music folder
    Expected file location: userIP/filename/filename# || ie: 127.0.0.1/revenge/revenge1 ../revenge2 ..ect

    direct = Boolean. if true, explicitly download the userIP as 

    This is probably wrong, because i added the 'direct' variable
    ~~This function is rather specific in HOW it downloads files; 
    Im not sure if it will be of use to others if i dont give you my ip.
    Technically i could leave my ip here, but that would not only be...
    anywhere between a waste of my 1mbit/s upload to a complete security risk,
    and i dont have a static ip, it will change weekly lol.~~

    Note. Wont download files if you do not have 
    (128*1028 == 131,584 == 128KB) bytes of storage space free,
    as this is also the size of the chunk.

splitMusic(filename)
    Splits a dfpwm file into (128*1028 == 131,584 == 128KB) chunks for partial downloading

    filename = name of file to divide. Will also make a new folder under this name;
    all the segments/chunks will be placed into filename/filename#

    an extra file will be made at filename/filename0, that will
    contain the number of chunks that were made.
    if the last chunk was filename/filename15, filename/filename0 will be 15

playMusic(filename, httpURL)
    Streams the given dfpwm file

    filename
